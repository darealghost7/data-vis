📊 Adult Income & Salary Analysis Project
A dual-part data analysis practice project exploring income patterns through the Adult Census dataset and custom salary prediction modeling.

🎯 Project Overview
This repository contains two separate but complementary data analysis practice projects:

1️⃣ Adult Census Income Analysis (AdultDataAnalyzer class)
Comprehensive analysis of the classic UCI Adult dataset, examining income patterns across demographics.

2️⃣ Salary Prediction Model (Linear Regression)
Simple predictive modeling showing relationship between experience, education, location, and salary.

🔬 Part 1: Adult Census Income Analysis
What It Does
Loads and cleans the Adult Census dataset

Handles missing values and standardizes column names

Creates a 4-panel visualization dashboard showing:

Gender & Income Distribution (stacked bar chart)

Age vs. Work Hours by income bracket (line graph)

Work Hours Distribution for low vs. high income (histogram)

Education Level across occupations (grouped bar chart)

Key Features
✅ Automatic column name detection (handles different naming conventions)
✅ Intelligent missing value imputation (mode for categorical, median for numerical)
✅ Duplicate removal
✅ Professional matplotlib styling

📈 Part 2: Salary Prediction Model
What It Does
Demonstrates linear regression on synthetic/clean data

Visualizes how experience, education level, and work location affect salary

Plots separate trend lines for Remote, On-site, and Hybrid workers

Features
Education markers: Bachelor's (○), Master's (□), PhD (△)

Location colors: Remote (red), On-site (green), Hybrid (blue)

Trend lines: Linear regression fit per location




🧠 Learning Outcomes
This practice project demonstrates:

✅ Data Cleaning - Handling missing values, duplicates, column standardization
✅ Exploratory Analysis - Grouping, aggregating, extracting insights
✅ Visualization - 4 chart types with professional styling
✅ Linear Regression - Simple predictive modeling
✅ OOP Design - Encapsulated analysis class with error handling
✅ Real-world Dataset - Working with messy, real data
